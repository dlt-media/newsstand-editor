## About Weave

Weave is a young web-based framework designed to seperate developers from dependency-heavy and overly complicated frameworks for one that is easy-to-use, understand, and to develop in. 

> [!NOTE]  
> This framework doesn't come with anything else than what is inside this repository, meaning that composer is not required, but is usable in this framework. 

Made with the [weave](https://github.com/weavable/framework/) package.
